mv is used to move files from one place to another. 

After typing mv, we type the name of the file we wish to move
Then we type the path to where we want to move the file.

The final part of this path indicates the name that we would like to give
to the file once it has moved.

If we do not indicate a path, then we are simply using mv to rename the file
